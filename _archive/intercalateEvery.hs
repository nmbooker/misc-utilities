{-
This is a generalised version of the original quick-and-dirty program
I wrote specifically to put the colons into a MAC address every two
characters.

You can now intersperse any string
of characters, and number of characters apart, not just colons every 2.

To deal with the MAC address, here's a sample interaction:

{-
intercalateEvery does the deed.  Everything else in this program
is for argument parsing, I/O and user error handling.

{-
Useful abstraction over standard library 'interact' function.

interactLines :: ([String] -> [String]) -> IO ()
interactLines f = interact $ unlines . f . lines

Functions for handling command line arguments and telling the user
when they're invalid.
