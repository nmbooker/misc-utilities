# Find in paths on stdin.

#e.g.

#    $ cat list_of_directories.txt | findio -type f -name "foo"

# = What This Solves =
#
# The standard Unix utility find(1) takes a list of paths to search in
# as its first non-command
# arguments, not as its last, so you can't use xargs(1) to invoke it
# across a list of directories from, say, a file.
#
# This fills that gap, by running find with the items on stdin as its
# first arguments, then appending the arguments you supply on the
# command line.

xargs -I{} find "{}" "$@"
