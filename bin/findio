#! /bin/bash

# Find in paths on stdin.

#e.g.
#
#    $ cat list_of_directories.txt | findio -type f -name "foo"

xargs -I{} find "{}" "$@"


# This wraps xargs(1) and find(1), because the xargs invocation for prepending
# arguments is fiddly.

# Note that, according to xargs(1) manual, the -I switch causes find to be
# called once for every item on stdin.
