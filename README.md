misc-utilities
==============

A selection of miscellaneous utilities I've written over the last few years

Note that some programs depend on others, so the bin directory will need
to be in your PATH at runtime.

Also note I might shift some of these scripts into their own self-contained
projects at some point, if I think they deserve it.
