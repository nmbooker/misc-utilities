misc-utilities
==============

A selection of miscellaneous utilities I've written over the last few years

Note that some programs depend on others, so the bin directory will need
to be in your PATH at runtime.

Also note I might shift some of these scripts into their own self-contained
projects at some point, if I think they deserve it.

# nursery

This is where I put scripts when I start writing them.  I move them into
bin when they're usable to some degree.

# License

All utilities in the package are, unless otherwise noted, distributed under
the GNU GPL v2 or higher.

Please see the file LICENSE for more details.
